Task:
Write a short command-line program which takes some input,
reads a couple of files, solves the problem and prints the
solution to screen. If you struggle solving the task or if
it takes you too long to solve, we would still like to see
what you've been able to come up with so far.

Problem:
We want to find all the words with a given length hidden in
a 2D grid. A word can be created by connecting neighboring
characters. You can not connect characters diagonally, only
vertical and horizontal. The words don't need to be in a
straight line, see the example below. We want these words
listed to us by length, then by alphabetical order.

Example:
Given this 3x3 grid:

jop
shn
tvq

With a minimum length of 3 characters, you'll want to find
these words in the grid and list them in the following
order:
- john
- shop
- hop
- ohs

For more examples, see the other files.

Input format:
- Path to the file with the grid to be solved
- Path to the word file with all the words to search for.
- Optional, specify a minimum length for the word to find.

Example input:
java Solver grid3x3.txt words.txt 3

Grid file format:
- A grid of ascii lower case characters (a-z).
- Each character represent a field.
- A newline character ("\n") separates each row.

Word file format:
- All lower case ascii characters (a-z).
- A newline character ("\n") separates each word.

Requirements:
- Must be written in Java (version doesn't matter).
- Unit tests to verify your solution (JUnit or similar).

What we're looking for when evaluating:
- Ability to solve the problem.
- Creativity and knowledge in how you solve the problem.
- Readability of the code, try to keep it simple.
- Anything bonus is a bonus.

Bonus:
- What 16 letter word is hidden in the 1000x1000 grid?
- Google check style.
- Write solution to disk.
- No third-party library other than for tests.
- Alternative and more efficient solutions.
- Add support for wildcard and/or empty field in grid. 
- Multi-threaded.
- Make it a Spring web application (beware large grids).
- Create a grid generator (maybe ensure long words exists).
